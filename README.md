The problem of insufficient knowledge of French-English language motivated the creation of a flash card program. 
To solve this problem, I utilized Python programming language and the Tkinter library. 
The program utilizes a CSV file that contains French words and their English meanings to provide users with a convenient 
and effective way of improving their language skills. The result of this project is a user-friendly application that enables 
individuals to expand their vocabulary and improve their French-English language proficiency.
